# Text-Encryption-Decryption-cpp
Encryption and decryption functionality for alphabetical letters in a given string. It uses a simple substitution method where each letter in the input text is replaced with a corresponding letter from a predefined mapping of normal letters to encrypted letters. The decryption process reverses this mapping to get the original text.
