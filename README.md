#Text-Encryption-Decryption

Description:

This is a simple text encryption and decryption program that utilizes a letter substitution technique. The program includes a set of normal letters and encryption letters that have been reversed. When the user inputs a text, the program replaces each normal letter with its corresponding encryption letter. If the user inputs a text that has already been encrypted, the program can also decrypt it back to its original form.

How to Run:

    Clone the repository onto your local machine.
    Navigate to the repository in your terminal.
    Compile the code by running g++ main.cpp
    Run the executable file by running ./a.out
    Follow the prompts in the terminal to encrypt or decrypt a text.

Note:

    The program is case sensitive.
    Only lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z' are encrypted and decrypted. Any other characters will remain unchanged.
